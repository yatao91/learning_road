## enum枚举使用

#### python枚举使用示例如下

> 1. 代码示例
>
> ```
> from enum import Enum, unique
> 
> @unique # 帮助我们检查保证没有重复值
> class Weekday(Enum):
>     Sun = 0 # Sun的value被设定为0
>     Mon = 1
>     Tue = 2
>     Wed = 3
>     Thu = 4
>     Fri = 5
>     Sat = 6
> ```
>
> 2. 访问方法示例
>
> ```
> >>> day1 = Weekday.Mon
> >>> print(day1)
> Weekday.Mon
> >>> print(Weekday.Tue)
> Weekday.Tue
> >>> print(Weekday['Tue'])
> Weekday.Tue
> >>> print(Weekday.Tue.value)
> 2
> >>> print(day1 == Weekday.Mon)
> True
> >>> print(day1 == Weekday.Tue)
> False
> >>> print(Weekday(1))
> Weekday.Mon
> >>> print(day1 == Weekday(1))
> True
> >>> Weekday(7)
> Traceback (most recent call last):
>   ...
> ValueError: 7 is not a valid Weekday
> >>> for name, member in Weekday.__members__.items():
> ...     print(name, '=>', member)
> ...
> Sun => Weekday.Sun
> Mon => Weekday.Mon
> Tue => Weekday.Tue
> Wed => Weekday.Wed
> Thu => Weekday.Thu
> Fri => Weekday.Fri
> Sat => Weekday.Sat
> ```
